A non-empty vector A consisting of N integers is given. A pair of integers (P, Q) is called K-complementary in vector A if 0 â‰¤ P, Q < N and A[P] + A[Q] = K.

For example, consider vector A such that:

  A[1] =  1  A[2] = 8  A[3]= -3   ## array in R are 1 indexed
  A[4] =  0  A[5] = 1  A[6]=  3
  A[7] = -2  A[8] = 4  A[9]=  5
The following 7 pairs are 6-complementary in vector A:

(1,9), (2,7), (5,9), (6,6), (7,2), (9,1), (9,5)
Given an integer K and a vector of N integers, Compute the number of k-complimentary pairs.

Given an array of integers A, return a list of integers that are present an odd number of times.

If A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 1, 2, 2, 4, 5]

Answer returned would be result = [2, 4, 5]

Given a sentence as a string, print out each unique character with the number of occurences in the string.

Example:
sentence = "Hi How are you today?"
result = "
H 1
i 1
o 3
w 1
a 2
r 1
e 1
y 2
t 1
u 1
d 1
"

Write an autocomplete feature as a command line program using the Google Places API: (https://developers.google.com/places/documentation/autocomplete)

The program should prompt the user for a search string. The user should need to press enter after the search string is typed for you to return results, and should then prompt the user for a search string again. This should continue until the user types QUIT.

What do you think the time complexity of such a program is? What are the factors the runtime complexity depends on?

Spotify is a great place to discover music. When browsing an artist's page on Spotify, Spotify has a "Popular" section that displays the name of a song, and the number of times the song has been listened to. 

Consider yourself an engineer at Spotify where you are to build this feature! 

You are to write the following function:

Array<Song> GetPopularSongsForArtist(int artistId, int N)
where N is the number of popular songs to return. Feel free to create the Song class as you would see fit.

Assume that following services already exist within the company:

* string GetSongById(int songId)
* int GetNumSongsForSongId(int songId)
* Array<Song> GetListofSongsForArtist(int artistId)

Feel free to write this in a language of your choice, and with any datastructures that you see fit for using.
What is the runtime complexity of such a solution?
