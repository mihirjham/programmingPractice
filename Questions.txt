A non-empty vector A consisting of N integers is given. A pair of integers (P, Q) is called K-complementary in vector A if 0 â‰¤ P, Q < N and A[P] + A[Q] = K.

For example, consider vector A such that:

  A[1] =  1  A[2] = 8  A[3]= -3   ## array in R are 1 indexed
  A[4] =  0  A[5] = 1  A[6]=  3
  A[7] = -2  A[8] = 4  A[9]=  5
The following 7 pairs are 6-complementary in vector A:

(1,9), (2,7), (5,9), (6,6), (7,2), (9,1), (9,5)
Given an integer K and a vector of N integers, Compute the number of k-complimentary pairs.
